        <h2 id="here-is-how-to-use-gengen">
          Here is how to use <code>gengen</code>:
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create one or more <strong>terms</strong> and enter a newline-separated list of possible values.
            The generator will select a random value from this list to appear in the output.
            <ul>
              <li>
                A term can be a <em>fragment</em>. Fragments are appended directly to the previous
                word rather than rendered separately (e.g., "Grognak" instead of "Grog nak").
              </li>
              <li>
                You can change a term's <em>inclusion probability</em>,
                which determines how likely it is to appear in the output.
              </li>
              <li>
                A term can have any number of <em>dependent</em> terms.
                A dependent term is included in the output only if its parent is included.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    A dependent term can have an additional <em>inclusion condition</em>.
                    If a term has an inclusion condition, it is included in the output only if
                    the value selected from its parent's word list matches the inclusion condition.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Run your generator by clicking <strong>generate</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clicking <strong>snippet</strong> will generate a JavaScript function that implements your generator.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clicking <strong>link</strong> will display a (long and ugly-looking) link to your generator.
          </li>
        </ul>
